# Helm chart to install AMQ Operator

This chart can be used to install AMQ operator namespace scoped or cluster scoped in OpenShift.

Values:

* `scope`: Scope of the operator installation (see _OperatorGroup_) - `cluster` or `namespace`
* `channel`: Catalog channel to be used - `7.x`, `7.10.x`, `7.11.x`
* `installPlanApproval`: `Manual` (recommended) or `Automatic`
* `startingCSV`: (optional, but recommended) e.g.: `amq-broker-operator.v7.11.0-opr-2`

The Helm chart also has hook:

* _post-install-hook-job_: Approves the _InstallPlan_ in case of `Manual` _installPlanApproval_
* _post-delete-hook-job_: Deletes the _ClusterServiceVersion_ when the Helm chart is uninstalled. Otherwise we would run into error when we reinstall again.

For cluster scoped installation of the operator it's recommended to use a dedicated namespace, where no other operators are installed. 

To change the installed operator version the recommended way is to uninstall and reinstall the Helm chart (with a new _startingCSV_).
