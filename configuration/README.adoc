= Configuration

== brokerProperties

The `brokerProperties` field in the _ActiveMQArtemis_ CR can be used for advanced configuration. Set a list of string with "object.field=value" expressions. Those values are set on the top of _broker.xml_, but they are not reflected in _broker.xml_ directly.

* See docs: https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/configuration-index.html

* Check the _Configuration_ object in source: https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/main/artemis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/core/config/Configuration.java

Examples:

* For some examples regarding advanced configuration options with the operator (e.g. `brokerProperties`), see https://github.com/andytaylor/stuff/tree/master/operator/broker
* Test class: https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/main/artemis-server/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/core/config/impl/ConfigurationImplTest.java

The implementation is based on https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/[Commons BeanUtils].


== Pre-create addresses

The operator creates addresses/queues for _ActiveMQArtemisAddress_ CRs like:

```
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
    name: topic1-queue1
spec:
    addressName: mytopic
    queueName: queue1
    routingType: multicast
    queueConfiguration:
      purgeOnNoConsumers: true
```

These addresses are created by the operator only after the broker has started and the Pod reached _ready_ state. This might be too late in same cases as the clients can connect to the broker before the Pod is ready (Service has `publishNotReadyAddresses: true`). To guarantee that the addresses are created before a client connects, we can add a `<addresses>` in _broker.xml_ with an init container, or use `brokerProperties` like this:

```
  brokerProperties:
    - addressConfigurations.mytopic.queueConfigs.queue1.routingType=MULTICAST
    - addressConfigurations.mytopic.queueConfigs.queue1.purgeOnNoConsumers=true
    - addressConfigurations.mytopic.queueConfigs.queue2.routingType=MULTICAST
    - addressConfigurations.myqueue.queueConfigs.myqueue.routingType=ANYCAST
```

See fields and values in https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/main/artemis-commons/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/api/core/QueueConfiguration.java[QueueConfiguration.java].

== Extra acceptor parameters

In case of acceptor parameters not supported by the _ActiveMQArtemis_ CR (e.g _openwireMaxPacketChunkSize_) we can use expressions like this:

```
  brokerProperties:
    - "acceptorConfigurations.myacceptor.extraParams.openwireMaxPacketChunkSize=-1"
```
