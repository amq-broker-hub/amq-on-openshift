= Red Hat AMQ Broker on OpenShift

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-amq/[Red Hat AMQ Broker] is the productized version of https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis] message broker. This guide is focusing on how to run AMQ Broker on OpenShift (or generally on K8s) using the AMQ Broker Operator, which seems to be the only recommended way.

Versions at the time of writing:

* AMQ Broker: *7.10.1*
* AMQ Broker Operator: *7.10.1-opr-1*

== Documentation

* Red Hat AMQ Broker v.7.10: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_broker/7.10
** Including operator documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_broker/7.10/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/index
* Upstream - Artemis User Manual: https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/
** I recommend reading this doc first to understand how Artemis works
